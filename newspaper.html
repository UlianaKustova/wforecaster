                <p class="news-content">We're used to seeing icicles hanging from roofs. However, in the Arctic there are special icicles that hang underwater and pose a deadly threat to ocean floor inhabitants. This phenomenon was discovered almost 30 years ago, but it wasn't until 2011 that a BBC team managed to film its formation process.</p>
                <p class="news-content">The formation of this extraordinary icicle is easily explained by science. Salt seawater freezes differently and turns not into solid ice, but into something resembling a porous wet sponge. Icebergs are literally riddled with small channels filled with salt water.</p>

They resemble either pipe sections or numerous suspended balls, their hue changing from white to dark blue-gray. The color depends on the cloud's thickness.</p>

This weather phenomenon can only be detected when the light source is behind the observer, and the light reflected from the cloud returns directly to the observer. Glory can be observed in mountains as one's own silhouette or during a flight as the plane's shadow on a cloud.</p>

                <p class="news-content">Unlike lightning, these flashes are characterized by a pronounced blue or red color and cover distances up to 100 km in length and diameter. This makes them an element of space weather, as northern lights and meteors originate in these areas.</p>
